        <h2>OpenBCI Development </h2>
        <p id="home-text">
          <i>What if simple brain-computer interfaces became a common tool for interacting with computers?</i>
          <br><br>
          Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable communication between the brain and an external device. While BCI’s have been developed in academic laboratories for decades, the OpenBCI will be the first low-cost, open-source neural interface available to the consumer market. We have the unique opportunity to collaborate directly with OpenBCI to develop the software library for the first public release of the OpenBCI board. 
        </p>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <ol id="home-text"><li>Create a modular, scalable, and approachable Python framework to enable the 
         development of applications that build upon OpenBCI technology.<li>Build drivers for existing BCI software libraries.
       </li></ol>

       <h2>Vibratto</h2>
       <p id="home-text">
        <!--
        <i>You are trapped.  You’re going to get shot and you know it.  Your body tenses up for the inevitable as the bullet ricochets off your chest.  Frustrated, you pull your headset off in the middle of your living room, unceremoniously abandoning your avatar in the game.  But even if your mind has left the game, your body still smarts from the twinge of the bullet’s vibrations.</i>
        <br><br>
        --> 
        The Vibrato Haptic Vest creates an immersive gaming experience by creating precise tactile feedback to the wearer's torso. Vibrato consists of a vest and sleeves with arrays of vibrotactile actuators that provide precisely-timed vibrations.  

        <!-- For example, if someone slashes you with a sword, you will feel a vibration that simulates how the sword strikes your skin (of course it wouldn’t hurt). 
      --> In addition to gaming interfaces, the wearable tactile device could be used for navigation, sports, dance, or physical training.  

      </p>

      <h2>LED Body Sensor Suit</h2>
      <p id="home-text"><i>All eyes are on you as you contort your body.  Stretching, and leaping, and standing, the LEDs on your body suit flicker from red to blue to purple.  Each joint in your body has its own story to tell—they are part of your dance, but they assert their existence to you, to your audience, themselves. In their luminescence, their little voices shout, “I exist!”</i>
        <br><br>
        The LED Body Sensor Suit is a tight black Lycra bodysuit with fabric flex sensors and corresponding LEDs placed at every major joint in the body.  Flexing joints change the LED from blue to red on a variable scale.
