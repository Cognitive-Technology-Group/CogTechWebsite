        <h2>OpenBCI Development Team</h2>
        <p id="home-text">
          <i>What if simple brain-computer interfaces became a common form of interacting with your computer? Imagine being able to control your smartphone or camera with your mind.  Imagine interacting within a virtual reality game or creating visualizations.</i>
          <br><br>
          Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable communication between the brain and an external device. While BCI’s have been developed in academic laboratories for decades, the OpenBCI will be the first low-cost, open-source neural interface available to the consumer market. Their first Kickstarter hit 250% of its original goal. We have the unique opportunity to collaborate directly with OpenBCI to develop a prototype and software library for the first public release of the OpenBCI board. 
        </p>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <ol id="home-text"><li>Create a modular, scalable, and approachable Python framework to enable the 
         development of applications that build upon OpenBCI technology.<li>Build drivers for existing BCI software libraries.
       </li></ol>

       <h2>Vibratto</h2>
       <p id="home-text">
        <i>You are trapped.  You’re going to get shot and you know it.  Your body tenses up for the inevitable as the bullet ricochets off your chest.  Frustrated, you pull your headset off in the middle of your living room, unceremoniously abandoning your avatar in the game.  But even if your mind has left the game, your body still smarts from the twinge of the bullet’s vibrations.</i>
        <br><br>
        The Vibrato Haptic Vest creates an immersive gaming experience by providing tactile feedback for wearers. Vibrato consists of a vest and sleeves with arrays of vibrotactile actuators that provide feedback for users in gaming.  For example, if someone slashes you with a sword, you will feel a vibration that simulates how the sword strikes your skin (of course it wouldn’t hurt). The wearable tactile device could also be used for navigation, sports, dance, or physical training.  
      </p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <ol id="home-text"><li>Hardware (vest and sleeves with arrays of mini smart vibrators)<li>Cross-platform API that enables easy game integration

      <h2>LED Body Sensor Suit</h2>
      <p id="home-text"><i>All eyes are on you as you contort your body.  Stretching, and leaping, and standing, the LEDs on your body suit flicker from red to blue to purple.  Each joint in your body has its own story to tell—they are part of your dance, but they assert their existence to you, to your audience, themselves. In their luminescence, their little screams shout, “I exist!”</i>
        <br><br>
        The LED Body Sensor Suit is a tight black Lycra bodysuit with fabric flex sensors and corresponding LEDs placed at every major joint in the body.  Flexing joints change the LED from blue to red on a variable scale.

      <h2>Cognitive Technology Forecasting</h2>
      <p id="home-text">The Cognitive Technology Forecasting team aims to create a road map and knowledge base of future developments in cognitive technology. We will create a timeline and wiki to help inform design decisions in the cogtech space.  We aim to identify potential long-term outcomes for the field and work backwards to their implications at our current point in history. We will focus on potential developments in the next 3 to 5 years that hacker groups like ours are capable of doing.  We will also connect with independent researchers, academic labs, and hacker groups. Our focal cluster are (1) neural engineering, brain-computer interfaces, body-computer interfaces, biosensors, biohacking (2) theoretical neuroscience, brain emulation, neural networks (3) sensory input/output, virtual reality, and immersive experiences.
