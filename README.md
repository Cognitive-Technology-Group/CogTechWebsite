CogTechWebsite
==============


##### Some of the priorities in developing the CogTech website:

* A description of current projects underway, that people can edit themselves. Similar to the projects page in the GDocs summer folder. 
* A way for people working on projects to coordinate with each other. I.e. MindMuse.  


##### Elements that are already on the current website

* events
* resources / important links
* equipment checkout


##### Elements to implement eventually
* Portfolio of completed projects
* Incubator for "future projects":
	* Where we put google docs and ideas for projects that we have discussed but haven't started building yet. 

 
## Development Notes
Branches for now: 
* online - the current live version of the site, synced with the server
* develop 
* master
